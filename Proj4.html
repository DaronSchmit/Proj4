<li>To prevent excuses such as "I swear I submitted my file to Moodle but it's not there when I checked it a few days later, please give me credit for my work," it is your responsibility&nbsp;to make sure that you uploaded the right file and writeup and that your file uploaded. You can double check this by downloading your submission from Moodle to make sure it is there.&nbsp;It is also recommended to not wait till the last minute to submit your project.&nbsp;You may submit as many times as you like before the deadline, so make sure you get something in by then.&nbsp;</li>
<li>All of your code should be able to run properly on the CSELabs machine.</li>
<li>There have been instances of students submitting the wrong file, or not attaching the right files, again, it is&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">your responsibility</span> to submit the right zip file with the right contents. To reiterate, mistakes after the deadline will not be pardoned as every one must adhere to a deadline, which is why it is called a deadline. <strong>For your sake, please redownload your submission and verify everything that should be there, is there.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<p>(This write-up might be very long, but do not skim through all the minute details as they are vital for the entire project.)</p>
<h5>Introduction</h5>
<div>
<p>Decision making requires sound data which often can be obtained from observation. For example, determining when the busy times are at the mall is possible by collecting data on the times of arrivals and departures of&nbsp;people at each door. Decision making about mall staffing levels can be made based on this relatively easily gathered data. However, there are many areas where the information gathering may be very difficult or even impossible. Such situations include "what if" scenarios or planning for certain future situations or events. To assist in these kinds of decisions, computer modeling can be used. Without actually observing a real-world system, software can be written to model the individual components of such a system. Then, the parameters can be changed to see how the system will behave under a variety of situations. The use of computer models can be a cost-effective tool, or in some cases, the only way to gather information about or predict the behavior of a possible system. Using an object oriented language (like Java) together with basic data structures that we have covered so far in class allows is to relatively easily create&nbsp;the discreet event simulation system to model a real-world scenarios.&nbsp;Note that discreet event simulation is one of many approaches to simulating a system, and it is the one that we will use in this project,&nbsp;Discreet event simulation is based on the creation of data objects that&nbsp;represent each of the components in the system. Time is modeled using&nbsp;an agenda (or priority queue) where future "events" are kept for simulation<br>in chronological order. Only time steps where an event occurs are considered by the simulation program.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Modeling the Grocery Store Checkout</strong></p>
<p>A local grocery store chain is considering moving from employee bagging&nbsp;to customer bagging of groceries at the checkout lane in the hope that&nbsp;they can reduce costs. However, the cost savings in not having to hire&nbsp;baggers may not make up for the additional costs of hiring some new&nbsp;cashiers. Of course, there are other concerns as well, but we will only&nbsp;consider throughput and the customer experience in our model. There is one&nbsp;more thing--do express lanes really help? You know those lanes for 10 items&nbsp;or fewer? We'll try to model that as well--how does the system compare&nbsp;when one or more of the checkout lanes are express lanes compared with having all checkout lanes the same? (Note that the total number of lanes will remain the same regardless of whether express lanes are used or not.)</p>
<p>The Car Wash example that we "acted out" in lecture has many parallels to this project. You may find it helpful to use some of the code for the&nbsp;Car Wash example in your simulation project, and that is O.K. Specifically, you should use the priority queue (PQ.java) as-is. But, be sure to credit any code "borrowed" from the posted lecture examples.</p>
<p><strong>The Environment to be Modeled</strong></p>
<p><br> We will assume the following adjustable system parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>A variable number of checkout lanes</li>
<li>Possibility to have one or two lanes restricted to 10 items or fewer</li>
<li>Average inter-arrival rate of shoppers at the checkout&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>We will assume the following constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shoppers will be passive, but they will contain data such as:</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1) time they entered a checkout line<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2) number of items in their cart (determined statistically,&nbsp;see below)</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrival of a shopper at a checkout lane will be provided by an&nbsp;arrival class that will generate arrivals for all the lanes&nbsp;(determined statistically, see below)</li>
<li>Checkout time is determined according to number of items in&nbsp;the shopping cart (see below)</li>
<li>Customer bagging increases the per-customer checkout time over employee bagging (see formula below)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>System Elements</strong></p>
<p>Simulation of the system is achieved by creating classes to model the&nbsp;behavior of each element of the system as well as each activity (event) that occurs in the system. There is NOT an overall controller that calls&nbsp;for actions to happen at particular times except for a main driver loop that runs queued events until time runs out. Each element in the system models its own behavior and interactions with other elements in the&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>For the Grocery Simulation, we have:<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Elements&nbsp;and the Classes to Represent Them</span></p>
<p>* Shoppers (Shopper) - passive and contain data only<br> * Arrival generator (ShopperMaker)<br> * Checkout Lanes (Checkers)<br> * agenda (PQ)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Events (actions)</span></p>
<p>Each NON-passive element class has an Event object class associated with it, or in the case of the ShopperMaker where there is only one instance, the class can also be the event. The associated event contains the run() method (as discussed in lecture) that simulates the specific behavior of that class.</p>
<p>* CheckerEvent (occurs each time a Shopper finishes checkout and leaves)<br> * ShopperEvent (one occurs for each Shopper entering the checkout system)</p>
<p>Let's look at each of these components, and see what they should contain.&nbsp;Please note that you may need to include other information, but what&nbsp;is given here is considered fundamental information to model the&nbsp;system.</p>
<p><strong>Shopper</strong></p>
<p>This is instantiable once for each Shopper entering the checkout system. As described above, this class is passive; it contains only data. In addition to arrival time and number of items in the cart, you may decide to put more data in the Shopper, but at least those two data items are necessary.</p>
<p><strong>ShopperMaker</strong></p>
<p>This is instantiable once for each Shopper creation event. Note that since one ShopperMaker will generate all of the Shoppers for the simulation, there is no need for multiple instances&nbsp;of this class--only multiple events. So, each instantiation of&nbsp;ShopperMaker will represent each ShopperMaker event.&nbsp;The class can be defined as:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; public class ShopperMaker implements Event {</p>
<p>This is similar to how the CarMaker class was implemented as described in lecture. ShopperMaker will create reschedule itself (using the agenda), create a Shopper, decide how many groceries the Shopper will have and <br>place the Shopper in a queue in front of a Checker.</p>
<p><b>Checker</b></p>
<p>This is instantiable once for each checkout line at the&nbsp;store. This is the representation of a checkout counter. Each Checker will have a queue associated with it, and most likely an index so that you can refer to a particular Checker. It might be best to create an&nbsp;array of Checker to hold each the checkout line instances. At minimum,&nbsp;the Checker class will have a queue to hold waiting Shoppers, and a&nbsp;boolean flag that indicated whether it is busy or not.</p>
<p><b>CheckerEvent</b></p>
<p>This implements the Event interface. A CheckerEvent&nbsp;is created for each completion of a customer's checkout. When a customer&nbsp;leaves with their bagged groceries, the CheckerEvent causes the Checker&nbsp;that created it to look to its queue to see if there is a Shopper waiting.&nbsp;If there is a Sho</p></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></body></html>
